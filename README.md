# Some-Robot-Framework-Test-Suite

These are just some test suites I wrote while practicing automation test using Robot Framework

## Goal

Write test scripts using Page Object Model

The spirit of this is to have front test suites file that have simply no trace of "technicality" or coding. I tried to use nested keywords that resulted in the keywords that I have in the test cases to be completely verbal and simply look like a sentence.
